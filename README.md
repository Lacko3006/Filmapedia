# Filmapedia

## Description
A web app that showcases information about a film; it will display information such as release date, actors, movie poster and more.
The web app demonstrates the ability to use a Javascript GET method to retrieve information using application programming interface (API).
Once the information about the film is displayed, the web app will have a button that takes the user to a wikipedia page using a second API.
The website also demonstrates the usage of a CSS framework called bulma to utilize the styling of the web application

Just above the "click hear" button is another button that uses the api to take the user to a wikipedia page about that film.
