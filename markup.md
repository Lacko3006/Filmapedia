'''Deadpool''' is an [[antihero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Fabian Nicieza]] and artist/writer [[Rob Liefeld]], the character first appeared in ''[[New Mutants]]'' #98 ([[cover-date]]d Feb. 1991). Initially, Deadpool was depicted as a [[supervillain]] when he made his first appearance in ''The New Mutants'' and later in issues of ''[[X-Force (comic book)|X-Force]]'', but later evolved into his more recognizable [[antiheroic]] persona. Deadpool, whose real name is '''Wade Winston Wilson''', is a disfigured [[mercenary]] with the superhuman ability of regeneration and physical prowess. The character is known as the "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke constantly, including breaking the [[fourth wall]] for humorous effect and running gags.

The character's popularity has seen him featured in numerous forms of other media. In the 2004 series ''[[Cable & Deadpool]]'', he refers to his own scarred appearance as "[[Ryan Reynolds|Ryan Renolds]] [''sic''] crossed with a [[Shar Pei|Shar-Pei]]".<ref>''Cable & Deadpool'' #2, p. 13.
